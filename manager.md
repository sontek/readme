# Manager README
Why hello there! If we’ve worked together before, or this is your first time
meeting me, the purpose of this document is to let you know who I am, how I
work, and what I value.

First off, if you'd like to find me around the internet:

- Twitter: https://twitter.com/sontek
- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/sontek
- Website: https://sontek.net/

I've been a software engineer and SRE since 2005 and moved into leading engineers
in 2015 as both a manager and start-up founder.

## Working Hours
- *Timezone*: https://time.is/AST
- *Working Hours*: 8am - 4pm AST 

Although I'm very consistent on starting my workday between 7 and 8, I do enjoy
flexing my hours.  I find that I lose my energy by the end of the day so
you'll usually see me leave early and then return later in the night to finish.

*NO GO ZONE*: 6pm - 9pm.  You'll see me often working in the evening but I reserve
6pm-9pm for dinner and time with my family. I do not accept meetings during this
time.


# About me (personally)
I will answer to John or sontek. I'm originally from Michigan, USA but I live in
Luquillo Puerto Rico on an off-grid 3 acres where I have a small fruit orchard,
garden, chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  I'm a certified welder in case you need
any metal attached to other metal.

I have two sons, Graham Wolfgang (2011) and Morgan Hawke (2013).

My hobbies:

- SCUBA
- Freediving
- Spearfishing
- Permaculture
- Open Source and Homelabbing

I consume a decent amount of beer and coffee and currently working on growing
my own hops, barley, and coffee so I can start making it all myself.


# About me (professionally)
As an elder millenial I started out running servers on-prem or in a datacenter
and coming up with cute naming conventions for my little pets. My journey so
far as been:

On-prem -> OpenStack -> Mesos -> Kubernetes

I'm a fan of Python, GoLang, and proper obsverability of the cloud.  I've done
my time at massively scale unicorns (SurveyMonkey, Zapier) as well as running
my own startup (EventRay) and love building systems and teams!

# Guiding Principles
I still love to dig deep on the tech side and can be a rubberduck if you need
to bounce some ideas around but I'm here to serve you as a manager and build out
processes that work for the team not against them.

### People
I value the people on the team more than the technology.  Programming is just
typing and anyone can learn and get better at that.  How you collaborate and
the attitude you bring towards helping the people around you grow and improve
is more valuable.


### Communication
I am best at asynchronous communication and don’t always voice my thoughts/plan
of action when a problem is initially verbally delivered. I take time to process
and think through the issue and how I would recommend solving it.

- I prefer asynchronous and public communication.  I try to keep sync and
  private communication to a minimum.
- I prefer to receive direct and blunt feedback. I'll give feedback however you
  like to receive it. I believe we do better when we’re invested in one
  another’s success and when we share feedback openly. I care about your success
  and will give you feedback to help you get better. I expect you to do the same
  for me.


### Celebrate wins, celebrate losses
I believe in creating environments where we are not afraid to take chances and
run experiments. Not every task we take on needs to be considered a win. We
will celebrate the wins and learn from the losses. The biggest wins are usually
learned from previous losses.

### (Over) Communicate
The stronger the communication, the stronger the team. We are running at hard,
big challenges with cross-functional teams. Clear, consistent communication can
solve many problems (read: *over-communicate*).

### Attitude matters
Sometimes the difference between a project succeeding vs. failing is the
attitude we use when we approach that project. Provide feedback on areas you
have concerns about. Once we commit, we should attempt to approach the project
with positive energy (and that could make all the difference).

# Working with me
My job within the team is to provide clarity, direction, and guidance. It’s my
responsibility to let the team and our stakeholders know what we’re working on
and why our projects are essential. I’m on the hook for our outcomes, but I
expect the team to work with me to make sure we’re making the right decisions.

## 1:1
We will have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. These meetings are for
you and I will not bring much if any agenda to them. These are *not* status
meetings, I'd rather discuss status async. The 1:1 is for:

- Personal connection
- How you're feeling at work
- Feedback
- Improving team/company
- Learning/growth

Do not wait for the 1:1 if you have something urgent. Slack me immediately!

## Team meetings
As stated before I do not believe that sync meetings are the most productive
use of a team's time and especially not for status updates so I prefer to keep
"stand-up" async and keep team meetings focused on bigger picture execution.

- I prefer having a bi-weekly meeting to discuss priorities and groom our
  backlog to make sure we are focused on the most important things.
- I prefer having a bi-weekly sprint retro where we discuss what went well and
  what did not.

These are the most important meetings of the week and this is where we will
spend time to work together, solve problems as group and raise issues.

## If you like personality surveys...
I have taken the Birkman assessment as you can view it [here](birkman.pdf)

# What do I expect from my team?
The team should understand their customer and work towards solving problems they
have.

## Teams do:
- Take care of each other, and hold each other accountable. Someone who helps
  colleagues succeed is always more valuable than a lone wolf. But being a hero
  and stretching yourself isn't helpful either.  Letting people know where they
  can improve is just as important as celebrating the great things they are
  accomplishing.

- Continuously learn and grow. I don’t expect everyone to know everything, but
  I do expect you to attempt to understand problems and find answers. If you
  can’t solve a problem, having well thought out investigation is good
  enough. Digging into hard problems is how to learn and grow!

- *Default to action*: Take control and own your own destiny. Don't wait for
  direction if you have a good idea.


## Teams don't:

- *Blame others*: Humans make mistakes. But when we frame mistakes as learning
  opportunities it generates a more productive converation. Praise and public
  and coach in private. You should feel comfortable telling people when they
  could've done something differently without it being personal.

- *Sulk in silence*: I believe in transparency.  Bring your concerns to me! You
  may not be the only one feeling the way you do.  The best way to address
  problems is to discuss them.
