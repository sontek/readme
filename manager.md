# Manager README
Why hello there! If we’ve worked together before, or this is your first time
meeting me, the purpose of this document is to let you know who I am, how I
work, and what I value.

First off, if you'd like to find me around the internet:

- Twitter: https://twitter.com/sontek
- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/sontek
- Website: https://sontek.net/

I've been a software engineer and SRE since 2004 and moved into leading engineers
in 2015.

## Working Hours
- *Timezone*: https://time.is/AST
- *Working Hours*: 8am - 4pm AST 

Although I'm very consistent on starting my workday between 7 and 8, I do enjoy
flexing my hours.  I find that I lose my energy by the end of the day so
you'll usually see me leave early and then return later in the night to finish.

*NO GO ZONE*: 6pm - 9pm.  You'll see me often working 9pm-11pm but I reserve
6pm-9pm for dinner and time with my family. I do not accept meetings during this
time.


# About me (personally)
I will answer to John or sontek. I'm originally from Michigan, USA but I live in
Luquillo Puerto Rico on an off-grid 3 acres where I have a small fruit orchard,
garden, chickens, ducks, and a turkey.

I have two sons, Graham Wolfgang (2011) and Morgan Hawke (2013).

My hobbies:

- SCUBA
- Freediving
- Spearfishing
- Permaculture
- Open Source and Homelabbing

I consume a decent amount of beer and coffee and currently working on growing
my own hops, barley, and coffee so I can start making it all myself.


# About me (professionally)
As an elder millenial I started out running servers on-prem or in a datacenter
and coming up with cute naming conventions for my little pets. My journey so
far as been:

On-prem -> OpenStack -> Mesos -> Kubernetes

I'm a fan of Python, GoLang, and proper obsverability of the cloud.  I've done
my time at massively scale unicorns (SurveyMonkey, Zapier) as well as running
my own startup (EventRay) and love building systems and teams!

# Guiding Principles
I still love to dig deep on the tech side and can be a rubberduck if you need
to bounce some ideas around but I'm here to serve you as a manager and build out
processes that work for the team not against them.

### People
I value the people on the team more than I value technology. I am protective of
the people on my team and believe in investing in their continued growth. I
care about the people that I work with and want to help them become better at
what they do.


### Communication
I am best at asynchronous communication and don’t always voice my thoughts/plan
of action when a problem is initially verbally delivered. I take time to process
and think through the issue and how I would recommend solving it.

- I prefer asynchronous and public communication.  I try to keep sync and
  private communication to a minimum.
- I prefer to receive direct and blunt feedback. I'll give feedback however you
  like to receive it. I believe we do better when we’re invested in one
  another’s success and when we share feedback openly. I care about your success
  and will give you feedback to help you get better. I expect you to do the same
  for me.


### Celebrate wins, celebrate losses
I believe in creating environments where we are not afraid to take chances. We
will celebrate the wins and learn from the losses. The best wins are learned
from previous losses.

### (Over) Communicate
The stronger the communication, the stronger the team. We are running at hard,
big challenges with cross-functional teams. Clear, consistent communication can
solve many problems (read: *over-communicate*). When in doubt, communicate out.

### Attitude matters
Sometimes the difference between a project succeeding vs. failing is the
attitude we use when we approach that project. Provide feedback on areas you
have concerns about. Once we commit, we should attempt to approach the project
with positive energy (and that could make all the difference).

# Working with me
My job within the team is to provide clarity, direction, and guidance. It’s my
responsibility to let the team and our stakeholders know what we’re working on
and why our projects are essential. I’m on the hook for our outcomes, but I
expect the team to work with me to make sure we’re making the right decisions.

## 1:1
We will have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. These meetings are for
you and I will not bring much if any agenda to them. These are *not* status
meetings, I'd rather discuss status async. The 1:1 is for:

- Personal connection
- How you're feeling at work
- Feedback
- Improving team/company
- Learning/growth

Do not wait for the 1:1 if you have something urgent. Slack me immediately!

## Team meetings
As stated before I do not believe that sync meetings are the most productive
use of a team's time and especially not for status updates so I prefer to keep
"stand-up" async and keep team meetings focused on bigger picture execution.

- I prefer having a bi-weekly meeting to discuss priorities and groom our
  backlog to make sure we are focused on the most important things.
- I prefer having a bi-weekly sprint retro where we discuss what went well and
  what did not.

These are the most important meetings of the week and this is where we will
spend time to work together, solve problems as group and raise issues.

## If you like personality surveys...
I have taken the Birkman assessment as you can view it [here](birkman.pdf)

# What do I expect from my team?
Know who their customer is and what they want. Whether it’s a software
development or operations team, we all have stakeholders counting on us. My
team should be familiar with their customers’ pain and make all decisions with
the customer in mind.

- *Support one another*: Someone who helps colleagues find success is always
  more valuable to me than a lone wolf. Team cohesion is essential to me, and
  I believe the whole team succeeds when working together. Your teammates'
  success is a direct reflection of your success.
- *Work the problem*: This is especially true in an emergency, but I expect
  those around me to try to find ways to solve issues that arise. I don’t
  expect everyone to know everything, but I do expect team members to find
  answers to questions. If you can’t solve 100% of a problem, just find a way
  to make things 1% better.
- *Tell me things*: Tell me what’s going wrong, and tell me what’s going right.
  Tell me about the opportunities you think we’re missing. Tell me about where
  things are unclear. I am counting on you to advise me and help me make good
  decisions. I want everyone to be successful, including you. Most importantly,
  if something is urgent, tell me so. Nobody should ever have to sit on
  something important.

  Don’t let me get surprised. Along with the importance of talking to me, don’t
  put me in an uncomfortable position because we haven’t talked about something.
  You can bring me bad news, but sooner is better. This is true as well for
  good news. The more you tell me about the good work you’ve done, the better
  I can evangelize your successes.
